            Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, users may need to take additional steps to disable
            tracking technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow users to opt-out of targeted advertising for
            mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or mobile device. For more information, users should check
            their mobile settings. They also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on the
            mobile device or app marketplace.
